# CS-210-Module-Eight

1. Summarize the project and what problem it was solving?

For this project, I was assigned to develop an object oriented programming application to create two clocks displaying simultaneously in both 12 hr and 24 hr formats. 

2. What did you do particularly well?

One thing done particularly well was adhering to industry standards for code clarity and efficiency. The code was effective and ensured that each function had a specific purpose.

3. Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

Enhancements could be made by implementing more efficient algorithms for updating and displaying clocks. Incorporating robust error handling mechanisms would make the code more reliable. These improvements could make the code more robust and maintainable. 

4. Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging part of the code was managing and updating the display of both clocks. I overcame this by planning the update logic and ensuring synchronization between the two displays. The following tools and resources I added to my support network: Integrated development environment, documentation, online forums, and version control system. 

5. What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Skills from this project that will be transferable to other projects include: object-oriented programming, code modularity, and following industry standards for code clarity. 
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This program was made maintainable, readable, and adaptable by providing clear and concise comments, using meaningful variables and class names, and structuring code in functions which make it easier to understand, maintain, and extend.
